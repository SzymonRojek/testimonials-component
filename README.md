### Building project - description challenge:

My challenge was to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as [possible](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).

I could use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. Do to the fact that I do not feel comfortable with grid yet, instead of it I have used the flexBox, why? Firstly, I want to achive very well the flexBox because is very powerfull technology and I want to familiarize myself with all it's details.

After a few days of adventure with flexbox, I can say that the flexBox gave me few problems, for example how to deal with gaps. It was a very tricky for me to create equal gaps between the boxes. Normally I would use flex-gap but Safari doesnâ€™t support it yet (nor stable Chrome) so I canâ€™t just plop it out there. At the end it was necessary to set the margin for different boxes and change it at different resolutions by @media.

Already at this stage of learning I know that flexbox is not good for building complex layouts in the general sense but it is amazing for setting content inside of elements. 

#### **ToDo:**
- Screenreader only text with sr-only class;
