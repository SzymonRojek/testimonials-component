### Building project - description challenge:

My challenge was to build out this testimonials section and get it looking as close to the design as [possible](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).

I could use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. Do to the fact that I do not feel comfortable with grid yet, instead of it I have used the flexBox. Firstly, I need to achive very well flexBox because is very powerfull technology and I want to familiarize myself with all it's details.

Already at this stage of learning I know that flexbox is not good for building complex layouts in the general sense but definitely it is amazing for setting content inside of elements.
