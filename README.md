### Building project - description challenge:

I could use any tools I like to help me to complete the challenge. Do to the fact that I do not feel comfortable with grid yet, instead of it I have used the flexBox. Firstly, I need to achive very well flexBox because is very powerfull technology and I want to familiarize myself with all it's details.

Already at this stage of learning I know that the flexbox is not good for building complex layouts in the general sense but definitely it is amazing for setting content inside of elements.
